Santander and DIO Partnership - Modeling and Diagramming of an iPhone Component

In this challenge, you will be responsible for modeling and diagramming the UML representation of the iPhone component, covering its functionalities such as Music Player, Telephone Device and Internet Browser.

## Context
Based on the 2007 iPhone launch video (link below), you should prepare the diagram of classes and interfaces using a UML tool of your choice. Then implement the classes and interfaces in .java file format.

## iPhone 2007 launch

Relevant minutes: 00:15 to 00:55
Features to Model Music Player
Methods: play(), pause(), selectMusic(String music)
Telephone
Methods: call(String number), answer(), initiateVoicemail()
Internet Browser
Methods: displayPage(String url), addNewTab(), updatePage()
goal
Create a UML diagram that represents the functionalities described above.
Implement the corresponding classes and interfaces in Java (Optional).

## Instructions
Watch the iPhone launch video to understand the main features.
Use a UML tool of your choice to create the class and interface diagram. You can use the model above (created in Mermaid syntax), an open-source alternative compatible with Markdown files like this one.
Optionally, if you are confident, you can implement the Java classes represented in your UML diagram.
Submit your GitHub repository according to the DIO platform guidelines. For example:
